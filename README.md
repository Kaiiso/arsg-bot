# ARSG-BOT

Have you ever dreamed of a Discord server for your group, your community or even your classroom?  
**ARSG Bot is built for classrooms** and is used as an open source project by Highschool IT students.      
 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

## Built With

* [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js/) - A powerful JavaScript library for interacting with the Discord API.
* [node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.

## Contributing

As I use this for my own classrooms and students, I know this might not be the perfect approach
for all the projects out there. If you have any ideas, just
[open an issue](https://github.com/qcarpentier/arsg-bot/issues/new) and tell me what you think.

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and make changes as
you'd like. **Pull requests are warmly welcome.**
